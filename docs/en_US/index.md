# Atlas plugin

# Coming soon : Hotspot

> The Atlas plugin allows you to connect from your Atlas to a Wifi network (with or without password).

To do this, go to the Atlas plugin, then select the Wifi equipment.
Here you can activate and then select the wifi you want (2.4Ghz and 5Ghz), then type the password and save.

For the moment, the plugin only takes into account access with DHCP.
