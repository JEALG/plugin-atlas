# Atlas plugin

# Coming soon : Hotspot

> The Atlas plugin allows you to connect from your Atlas to a Wifi network (with or without password).

To do this, go to the Atlas plugin, then select the Wifi equipment.
Here you can activate and then select the wifi you want (2.4Ghz and 5Ghz), then type the password and save.

For the moment, the plugin only takes into account access with DHCP.

> Recovery (BETA)

You must plug a usb key of more than 10GB into the right USB port (Black) at the bottom. once done you can launch the key recovery and follow the instructions displayed on the screen.
This allows your Atlas to launch on this USB stick. Vous avez du coup accès à votre Atlas recovery mode sur http://jeedomatlasrecovery.local. it will suffice to inform the user: admin and password: admin.Then, you will need to correctly enter your market account so that your Atlas recovery can restore to the box's internal memory (eMMC). just follow the on-screen instructions.
> Important: Since January 2024, the image that will be installed contains Debian 11 as well as Core Jeedom in version 4.3.21
